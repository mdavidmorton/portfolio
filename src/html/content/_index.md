title: I make stuff for the web
summary: Writer, developer and editor living in Chattanooga, Tennessee
---

My name is David Morton. I have worked in journalism, the nonprofit sector and marketing. Throughout my career, I have gravitated toward projects that benefit communities and inform citizens and consumers.

I solve problems with a mix of technologies. Sometimes that means writing with pen and paper. Sometimes it's analyzing data from the command line. Sometimes it's leading teams to produce awesome content. Often it's a mix of all of the above.

This portfolio is divided into three sections.

[Writing](#writing) includes copy samples. They include marketing, promotional writing and news clips.

[Dev](#dev) highlights some of my work in data visualization and front-end web development.

[Editorial](#editorial) mixes the two. It's my favorite because the projects are collaborative and multidisciplinary.
