My name is David Morton. I have worked in journalism, the nonprofit sector and marketing.

Throughout my career, I have developed a unique skillset to solve problems. I'm as comfortable writing with pen and paper as I am working from the command line. And I enjoy collaborating with diverse teams to find new ways to tell stories and explore ideas.

My portfolio is organized by my work as a [writer](/copy), [developer](/dev) and [editor](/editorial). [Get in touch](mailto:michaeldavidmorton@gmail.com) if you want to learn more.
