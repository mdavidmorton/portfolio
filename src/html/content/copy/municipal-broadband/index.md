This is a series of news reports on a municipal broadband provider seeking to expand its services to so-called "digital deserts" â€” areas where no broadband internet is available. The push to move into these markets was resisted by private telecom companies, and ultimately the state of Tennessee, despite a favorable decision made by the Federal Communications Commission on the municipal provider's behalf.

My reporting examined broadband technology, telecom politics, and the regulatory structure that became the subject of a federal lawsuit. I covered the backgrounds of the individuals who fought to get better internet connections at their homes and businesses.
