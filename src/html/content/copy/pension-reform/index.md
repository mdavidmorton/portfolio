These are highlights from months of reporting I did on an effort to overhaul the city's retirement benefits for police officers and firefighters. The overhaul was intended to shore up a projected $150 million funding gap.

My reporting covered significant territory of this story. I dove into the behind-closed-door negotiations between union leaders and city officials. I analysed the relevant funding issues and financial projections. And I reported on the backgrounds of emergency responders who would be affected by the changes.
