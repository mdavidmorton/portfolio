This research report is part of a series on education funding. It covers revenue sources for public schools in Hamilton County, Tennessee.

My primary contribution was two data visualizations. The first compares [funding from federal, state and local sources](https://metroideas.org/projects/the-cost-of-education/follow-the-money/#funding-sources-chart) for Tennessee's eight largest school systems. The second shows an [historical overview of Hamilton County funding](https://metroideas.org/projects/the-cost-of-education/follow-the-money/#inflation-adjusted-revenue-chart).

I also provided editorial support and web development to this article. I shaped the overall narrative and document structure from underlying research, simplified technical copy, and produced tables and information boxes to help readers more easily navigate the information.
