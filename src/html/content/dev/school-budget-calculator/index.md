This [calculator](https://metroideas.org/projects/hcde-tax-calculator/#react-root) helps citizens determine how their education priorities would impact school system funding. It was published prior to a vote on raising the property tax rate in Hamilton County, Tennessee.

The calculator allows users to set their priorities for the local school system and find out how much their preferences would change their property tax bills as well as the overall school system budget. The results can be shared as custom posts on social media platforms.

It was developed with React and incorporates custom UI elements, such as range sliders, information drawers and on/off toggles. I also contributed copy for the calculator and informational text explaining each input control.
