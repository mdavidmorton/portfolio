This research report determines how much property tax revenue is generated in geographic areas (census tracts) in Hamilton County, Tennessee.

I cleaned, encoded and analyzed more than a million property tax bills to arrive at the conclusions reached in the report. My analysis confirmed that dense urban development in downtown Chattanooga results in a significant increase in tax revenue compared to suburban areas in the county â€” even when the latter has a high percentage of commercial and industrial real estate.

My data analysis was done with Python and Postgres.
