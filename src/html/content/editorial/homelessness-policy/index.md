This article examines housing first policies across the country to combat homelessness. The piece was written by a researcher at Metro Ideas Project.

As editor, I worked with the author to develop the piece, tighten the source material and write final copy. We engaged other staff members to identify any potential problem spots. We went through multiple drafts to ensure we met our objectives for this piece.

The policy outlined in this article was incorporated into the [2018 Homelessness Action Plan](https://connect.chattanooga.gov/cich/) by the city of Chattanooga later that year.
