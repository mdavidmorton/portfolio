This research project includes two reports, three case studies and a sample web application that collectively examine the benefits of a proposed open data policy for the county government of Hamilton County, Tennessee.

As project editor, I worked with researchers to create the project structure, wrote the reports' copy, and developed a Node web app to demonstrate how open data can be leveraged for community insights.
