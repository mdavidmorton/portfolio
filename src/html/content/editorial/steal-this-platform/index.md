In anticipation of a county election, Metro Ideas Project prepared a platform of ideas and policies for candidates to adopt. The report was a collaboration of proposals from staffers, interns and freelancers.

As editor, I established the report's overall structure and art direction. I facilitated the discussions and brainstorming sessions that led to its final content. I reviewed submissions and worked with contributors to hone their background research. I wrote the final copy from their submissions and developed the HTML and CSS to publish the material on the web.
