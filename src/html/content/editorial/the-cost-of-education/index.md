This research project consists of five reports, nine data visualizations and two interactive features investigating how much money is spent per student in public schools in Hamilton County, Tennessee.

I worked with research staff to establish the project's structure, art direction and editorial tone. I developed the [data visualizations](/dev/follow-the-money/) accompanying the reports with D3, as well as an [interactive map](https://metroideas.org/projects/the-cost-of-education/map-hamilton-county-school-spending/) and [location-based reports](https://metroideas.org/projects/the-cost-of-education/brief/) for readers to learn more about the schools in their neighborhoods. I also edited the reports' copy and headlines.
